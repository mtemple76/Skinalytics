## Skin care. Personalized. Easier. Faster.

We are using crowdsourced data about skin type, demographics, geography, and skin sensitivities to skin care products with a skin care product ingredient database to better understand contact irritant dermatitis, a form of dermatitis that might occur due to sensitization of your skin to an ingredient or ingredients in skin care products. We use analytics and machine learning to determine ingredients for you to avoid based on your skin type, demographics, and geography and others like you who have experienced skin reactions.
